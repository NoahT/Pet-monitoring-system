# ECE196 Hardware Project - Constraints
## Introduction
This markdown file lists the appropriate constraints of the dog mobility sensor hardware project for ECE196. As a team, we outlined the limiting factors that will influence the final iteration of our design. The discussed constraints are listed below by category:
- **Economic constraints**: Our entire team decided to choose the line following smart robot kit for the hardware project. In addition to this kit, the ELEGOO UNO R3 starter kit was included with our shipment. Since we are interested in developing a mobility sensor that is more economically viable than the existing solutions discussed in our fourth update such as the dog halo, with cheaper models costing approximately $60.00, we constrained the budget of this project to $30.00 or less.
- **Environmental constraints**: Due to social distancing, as a group we must coordinate the design phase, prototyping, and final product in a remote environment. Furthermore, not every member of our group owns a pet. Consequently, prototype testing will be done to the best of our ability with the resources at hand. (For instance, one member of our group is currently using a stuffed animal the size of a small dog in order to test our project)
- **Time constraints**: We embarked on this project on May 3rd, 2021. Since this project is due on May 26, 2021, our project timeline is constrained to approximately three weeks.
- **Safety constraints**: This hardware project is intended to be used as a multipurpose mobility sensor for dogs. We consequently placed constraints on the comfort of the mobility sensor. Additionally, we took into account the largest amount of current we can use with our mobility sensor that is still safe to use on dogs. We constrained the maximum amount of current drawn to 50mA, which is [consequently the maximum current draw for the 3.3V power supply for the UNO R3](https://components101.com/asset/sites/default/files/component_datasheet/Arduino%20Uno%20Datasheet.pdf), and is [regarded as a safe current draw for pets and humans](https://sites.google.com/dartmouth.edu/safety/electricity?authuser=0).
- **Manufacturing Constraints**: Since this course is being taught remotely, additional attention is placed on the manufacturing constraints of the project. As a team, we will not have access to facilities on campus to laser cut or 3D print parts on our own time. If any manufacturing is done, we plan to coordinate this effort ahead of time in anticipation of the 5-7 day buffer before parts are shipped to us.
